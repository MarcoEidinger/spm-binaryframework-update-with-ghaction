# Opiniated shell script to update version and checksum information for a binary target in a Swift Package
# Script assumes that a Swift Package has
# - a statement `let version = "<version>"`
# - only 1 binary target

# also the paths and naming pattern of the zip file is hard-coded so shell script needs to be adjusted for other packages

# Check for arguments
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No arguments provided. First argument has to be version, e.g. '1.8.1'"
    exit 1

# assuming this script is executed from directory which contains Package.Swift
# take version (e.g. 1.8.1) as argument

# download new zip file
